# Advanced Data Mining Techniques for Direct Marketing Campaigns

This repository contains code for implementing advanced data mining techniques for analyzing and predicting the success of direct marketing campaigns. The project uses Python and popular machine learning libraries to preprocess data, build and evaluate predictive models.

## About

Direct marketing campaigns play a crucial role in business strategies. This project aims to analyze customer data and predict the likelihood of a successful campaign. By utilizing machine learning models, we can optimize marketing efforts and achieve better results.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is "bank-additional.csv." It contains various features related to marketing campaigns and whether the client subscribed to a term deposit ('yes' or 'no'). The goal is to predict the success of future marketing campaigns based on this data.

## Models Used
**Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)**
